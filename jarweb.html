Jar Jar Binks was a Gungan male military commander and 
politician who played a key role in the Invasion of Naboo
and the Clone Wars that culminated in the fall of the Galactic 
Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Once an outcast 
from Gungan society due to his clumsy behavior, he regained 
favor with his people by helping secure an alliance 
between the Gungan boss Rugor Nass and Queen Padm√© Amidala of 
Naboo, an alliance vital in ending the Trade Federation's 
invasion of their shared homeworld. In the years that 
followed, Binks became a Junior Representative for his people
in the Galactic Senate, serving alongside Amidala once she 
became the planet's senator.Ten years after the Naboo 
Crisis, growing tensions between the Galactic Republic and 
the Confederacy of Independent Systems threatened an outbreak
 of full-scale galactic war. In the absence of Senator 
Amidala, whose life was under threat by Separatist assassins,
 Binks was convinced by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine to
 propose that the chancellor receive emergency executive 
powers to raise a Grand Army of the Republic. The proposal was
 a success, leading to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, during
 which time Binks participated in a number of diplomatic 
missions for the Galactic Senate.The emergency powers Binks
 proposed were ultimately used by the chancellor, secretly
 the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, to amass total power and transform 
the Republic into the Empire. In the years that followed,
 Binks became an outcast on Naboo, due to his role in the rise
 of the Empire. By the time of the Battle of Jakku, Binks was 
a street performer in the capital city of Theed, where he was
 scorned by adults but beloved by the children who came to watch his antics.
